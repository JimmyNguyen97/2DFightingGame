# 2DFightingGame
2D JavaScript Fighting Game - OOP


Using Object Oriented Programming, created a 2D "Street Fighter" type game.
-Characters are created with a parent class, "Sprites". Adding shared properties to Sprites so that "Player" and "Enemy" can inherit these properties.
--We are able to update just the parent class and have the properties applied to the characters without having to update the characters individually.

Animated commands/actions such as: idle, run, jump, fall, attack, hit, death.
-By using image of images, we iterate through the image to create the animation.
