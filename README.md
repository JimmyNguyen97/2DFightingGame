2D JavaScript Fighting Game - OOP


Using Object Oriented Programming, created a 2D "Street Fighter" type game. Characters are created with a parent class, "Sprites". Adding shared properties to Sprites so that "Player" and "Enemy" can inherit these properties. We are able to update just the parent class and have the properties applied to the characters without having to update the characters individually.

Animated commands/actions such as: idle, run, jump, fall, attack, hit, death. By using image of images, we iterate through the image to create the animation.
